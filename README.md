Minimal yet powerfull config file based features-like toolkit for Drupal 7.

## FAQ

### But why?

Why not. Features is slow to revert, features need to be configured via the
UI, and features are not easy to modify manually, features may bring weird
conflicts, and features don't know what to do when there is an error and get
broken. You can't define things easily, you can make objects inherit from
each other one, and features uses CTools, supports Views, and push forward
very bad practices. Drupal Way is unperformant, unperforming, and I needed
something to write things faster and make things run faster.

### But why Yaml?

Why not, and you can use plain old PHP arrays instead if you don't like it.
It will work like a charm.

### Why should I use it?

I'm not your mamma, if you like to click, use features. Choice is yours. Oh
and it's an experimental, unfinshed product, so I would be you, I wouldn't
use it.
